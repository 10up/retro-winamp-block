== Changing Player Skins ==

In order to select alternate player skins, browse [the Winamp Skin Museum](https://skins.webamp.org/) and find a preferred skin, copy the URL of the specific skin (e.g., https://skins.webamp.org/skin/bb0bf8064d108271afea419308dcb6ea/NES_Duck_Hunt.wsz/), and paste that URL in the `Skin URL` field in the Webamp Block Skin settings.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= This is amazing, how can I help contribute to this plugin? =

Great question and I could not agree with you more!  You can help contribute to this [Webamp Block plugin on GitHub](https://github.com/10up/webamp-block) or to the [Webamp project on GitHub](https://github.com/captbaritone/webamp).

= Ok this is making me nostalgic, how can I submit a new skin for the player? =

Details on how to create a new skin is available [here](https://github.com/WACUP/Winamp-Skinning-Archive/blob/master/Classic%20Skins/Winamp_skinning_tutorial_1_5_0.pdf).  I would recommend downloading the [base Winamp skin](https://skins.webamp.org/skin/5e4f10275dcb1fb211d4a8b4f1bda236/base-2.91.wsz/), renaming the file extension from .WSZ to .ZIP, unzipping that file and inspecting all the bitmap and textfiles.  Then use your favorite design program to craft a skin design, cut it up into the component bitmap parts, add your info to the relevant textfiles, then ZIP all that up and rename the extension to WSZ.  Finally, [upload your custom skin](https://skins.webamp.org/upload/) to the Winamp Skin Museum and once its accepted you'll be able to reference it within the Webamp Block's Skin settings.  Good luck!
